            My favorite Zelda game and moment:
        </h2>
            <p>
                My <b>favorite</b> Zelda game is Zelda: Ocrina Of Time. I grew up playing <i>this</i> version of Zelda
                when I was a child. In fact, it was my first Video Game I've beaten. My favorite moment
                in the video game was one I finally learned to song in order to get Epona, the horse, and
                ride with her along the game! If you want to learn how to get the song so you can, yourself,
                get Epona in the game, just click the link that follows.

            <h3>
                Here are a few reasons that I think this is one of the greatest games ever created:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First real open world game to use polographical references.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ahead of its time in terms of story telling and character development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Still widely aruged to be greatest game of it's time, with multiple remasters to date.
                    </li>
                </ol>
